# weierstrass
Numeric Weierstrass transform in Javascript.

I won't publish this trivial, half-baked package to NPM, but if you have a need to use it, you can install it with:

```
npm install --save https://github.com/RyanMarcus/weierstrass.git
```


Use the `weierstrass` function, which takes in an array of points and returns a function that will interpolate values.
